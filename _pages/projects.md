1. Zhou, H., Majka, E. A., Wang, M., & Yang, Y. Some stone is better left unturned: When face masks surprisingly reveal rather than conceal the true heart. Manuscript in preparation.

-	This paper found in five experiments that perceivers could more accurately judge the authenticity of a smile displayed by a stranger when the lower half of the face was covered by a mask versus left uncovered. Interestingly, most perceivers mistakenly believed that they would have been more accurate if they could peek behind the masks.  

2. Zhou, H., Wang, C., Wang, M., & Yang, Y. Suppressed pleasantness in interest. Manuscript in preparation.

-	This paper tries to reconcile the conflicting findings in the literature about the relationship between pleasantness and interest within the framework of emotional appraisal theory. Using replication data and Bayesian simulation data, we found a positive correlation between pleasantness and interest when confounders were controlled, but no or negative correlation when confounders were not controlled.
