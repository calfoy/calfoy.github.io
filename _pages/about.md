Hi! I'm a researcher interested in behavioral and psychological studies. Currently, I am a 1st year PhD student in Marketing at [London Business School](https://www.london.edu/phd/profiles/). Before joining LBS, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Social Sciences (psychology) from University of Hong Kong and worked as a research assistant at ShanghaiTech University. I am very curious about the psychological precedents behind people's behaviors, choices and judgments, and I hope to conduct some interesting research that might be informative or change-provoking! 


Research interest: judgment and decision making, social cognition, moral judgment, emotions, and consumer wellbeing
